                        <p n="1">The pseudo-Aristotelian <title ref="#ArPr">Problems</title> is an
                            extensive collection of questions and proposed answers concerning a wide
                            range of subjects, including biology, mathematics, and physics, divided
                            topically into thirty-eight sections. The nineteenth of these sections
                            preserves the first substantial account of ancient Greek music making
                            and theorizing to have been rediscovered in the medieval period. This
                            material held great promise for medieval thinkers seeking to learn more
                            about the foreign world of ancient Greek music, whose legendary
                            emotional power had been lamentedly lost, and the text’s attribution to
                            Aristotle imbued it with special authority. Yet the <title ref="#ArPr"
                                >Problems</title> was also a challenging text to decipher. Not only
                            was the subject manner often unfamiliar, the manuscript tradition of the
                            Greek text is also corrupt in places. Furthermore, the first complete
                            Latin translation, made by Bartholomew of Messina (fl. 1258–66),
                            observed the common medieval practice of verbatim, indeed servilely
                            literal, word-for-word translation. For all these reasons, potential
                            readers of the <title ref="#ArPr">Problems</title> were in sore need of
                            orientation and explanation.</p>
                        <p n="2">Into the breach strode Pietro d’Abano (c. 1257–1316), who was a
                            professor of medicine with wide-ranging interests and expertise. Pietro
                            composed his <title>Expositio</title>, the first commentary on the entirety of the Problems in
              the first decade of the fourteenth century, and there are more than twenty extant
              manuscripts of it, as well as multiple early print editions. His commentary also
              attracted the attention of his contemporaries, most notably Jean de Jandun (c.
              1285–1328), a philosopher and theologian of considerable importance based at the
              University of Paris, who produced a revision of the entire <title>Expositio</title>. Moreover, Pietro’s commentary on
                            the problems of section XIX, in particular, was the first widely
                            circulated medieval attempt to interpret and assimilate rediscovered
                            knowledge about music in the ancient world, and his explanations
                            consequently became a touchstone for later generations of music scholars
                            who referred to the <title ref="#ArPr">Problems</title>, including
                            Franchino Gaffurio, Girolamo Mei, and Francisco de Salinas. Most
                            recently, Claude Palisca has called attention to Pietro’s anticipation
                            of Renaissance modes of scholarship (<ref target="#Palisca1985"
                                >1985</ref>), and David E. Cohen has demonstrated that Pietro’s
                            idiosyncratic interpretations of some of the problems concerning music
                            played an important role in the development of the music-theoretical
                            concept of harmony (<ref target="Cohen2012">2012</ref>). Yet despite the
                            inherent interest of Pietro’s commentary as a site of cross-cultural
                            engagement and its historical significance to later music theorizing,
                            his commentary on section XIX, on music, has been inaccesible to
                            scholars, for until recently it had not been published in any form since
                            the sixteenth century’s sadly unreliable print editions. Even that
                            recent publication (<ref target="#Meyer2022">Meyer 2022</ref>), however,
                            does not provide a proper critical edition of the text, as it is based
                            on a sixteenth-century print edition, only considers half the extant
                            manuscripts, and fails to distinguish between Pietro's first version of
                            his commentary and his later revision (see section <ref
                                target="#preface-subsection-2.1">2.1</ref>). The present critical
                            edition rectifies that situation, establishing a base text informed by a
                            stemmatic hypothesis of the complete manuscript tradition. Furthermore,
                            this edition is openly accessible, and it presents a semantically
                            encoded version of the text, allowing readers to select the types of
                            variants they wish to consider. As a result, it provides a better
                            informed version of Pietro's commentary and makes it more widely
                            available than ever before. </p>

                            proposed, often accompanied by additional explanation. For instance, the
                            first problem continues: <quote rend="inline">Is it so that the former
                                mourn less, but the latter rejoice more?</quote> (<foreign
                                xml:lang="la">Aut ut hii quidem minus tristentur, alii autem ut
                                magis gaudeant</foreign>?) In his commentary Pietro follows a
                            similar pattern. He first paraphrases the opening question, and then
                            addresses the remainder of the problem, dividing it into between one and
                            seven parts, depending on its length. He signals the beginning of each
                            successive division of the text with its first word or two, followed by
                            a partial or complete paraphrase. Given the unidiomatic Latin of
                            Bartholomew of Messina’s translation and the common occurrence of
                            obscure vocabulary, Pietro’s paraphrases provide an important means of
                            ingress to the text on their own. He often supplements these paraphrases
                            with additional explanatory material, both his own and by authors from
                            antiquity. In the latter case, he often provides cross-references to
                            other pertinent passages within the <title ref="#ArPr">Problems</title>
                            (from both section XIX and other sections), and he also inserts
                            abbreviated quotations, most often from the Aristotelian and medical
                            corpora.</p>

                        <p n="1">Establishing the best text of Pietro d’Abano’s commentary is no
                            simple task, for it survives in several different forms. By analyzing
                            variants in the introduction with which Pietro starts his commentary on
                            the <title ref="#ArPr">Problems</title>, Gijs Coucke has demonstrated
                            that Pietro produced a revised version of his commentary after the
                            initial version was complete (<ref target="Coucke2008">2008</ref>, vol.
                            2, xlii–xliv). About a quarter of the extant manuscripts derive from the
                            initial version, another quarter from the revision, and the remaining
                            half of the manuscripts descend from the revision made by Jean de Jandun
                            (concerning which see <ref target="Swaenepoel2009">Swaenepoel
                            2009</ref>). While these latter manuscripts do not aid in the
                            reconstruction of the text(s) Pietro himself wrote, they provide
                            important testimony as to the work’s reception in the Parisian
                            university scene, and consequently I have recorded variants from five
                            selected manuscripts in the critical apparatus. Coucke notes that “all
                            manuscripts appear to have the identical explicit, which refers to 1310
                            as the year in which Peter finished his <title>Expositio</title>” (<ref
                                target="Coucke2008">2008</ref>, vol. 2, xliv)—that presumably being
                            the date when the initial version was completed.</p>
                        <p n="2">Further complicating matters, some of the manuscripts change
                            affiliations partway through the lengthy work. As Joan Cadden has
                            observed, manuscript P<hi rend="superscript">z</hi>
                            <quote rend="inline">contains the first half of Pietro’s version and the
                                second half of Jean’s,</quote> and manuscript E<hi
                                rend="superscript">a</hi> has the converse arrangement (<ref
                                target="Cadden2013">2013</ref>, 228). Additionally, in his edition
                            of section IV of the <title>Expositio</title>, Coucke identifies
                            manuscript V<hi rend="superscript">b</hi> as deriving from Pietro’s
                            revised version, whereas by section XIX it hews more closely to the
                            initial version. (Furthermore, manuscript P<hi rend="superscript">q</hi>
                            contains Jean’s version in sections IV and XIX, but by section XXVII it
                            appears to have changed to Pietro’s version [<ref target="Coucke2008"
                                >Coucke 2008</ref>, vol. 2, xxvi].) As a result, I have preserved
                            Coucke’s manuscript sigils, but not his labeling of families and
                            conjectured sub-types. For instance, Coucke labels Pietro’s first and
                            second versions <emph rendition="#bold">P<emph rendition="#sub"
                                >a</emph></emph> and <emph rendition="#bold">P<emph rendition="#sub"
                                    >b</emph></emph>, respectively whereas I call them α and κ.
                            (This change is made in part to avoid the confusing use of letters in
                            Coucke’s <foreign xml:lang="la">Conspectus siglorum</foreign>, where the
                            manuscripts elsewhere labeled as <emph rendition="#bold">P<emph
                                    rendition="#sub">b</emph></emph> are listed under heading A, and
                            those as <emph rendition="#bold">P<emph rendition="#sub">a</emph></emph>
                            under heading B.)</p>
                        <p n="3">In classifying the manuscripts I used Coucke’s findings on section
                            IV as a point of departure. I collated all the manuscripts’ versions of
                            section XIX’s tenth problem to test the validity of Coucke’s findings to
                            section XIX. Then I collated all the manuscripts representing solely
                            either Pietro’s first or his second version (with the exception of M<hi
                                rend="superscript">b</hi>, to be discussed below), along with
                            manuscripts E<hi rend="superscript">a</hi> and P<hi rend="superscript"
                                >z</hi> (since their classification differs between sections IV and
                            XIX), and four representative manuscripts from the Jean de Jandun
                            redaction.</p>

                        <p n="1">The first version of Pietro’s commentary on section XIX of the
                                <title ref="#ArPr">Problems</title>, which I label α, is found in
                            five manuscripts: N<hi rend="superscript">u</hi>, P<hi
                                rend="superscript">y</hi>, V<hi rend="superscript">a</hi>, V<hi
                                rend="superscript">b</hi>, and E<hi rend="superscript">a</hi>.
                            Manuscripts N<hi rend="superscript">u</hi> and P<hi rend="superscript"
                                >y</hi> usually carry the best version of this text. Unfortunately,
                                N<hi rend="superscript">u</hi>’s codex has lost a number of pages,
                            resulting in total loss of the text from a point partway into problem 9
                            through problem 15, and again from the end of problem 38 through the end
                            of the section.</p>
                        <p n="2">Manuscripts V<hi rend="superscript">a</hi> and V<hi
                                rend="superscript">b</hi> are associated by shared error. The most
                            salient of these occurs in problem 20, where they repeatedly mistake
                            discussion of the Greek language (<foreign xml:lang="la">oratio
                                greca</foreign>) for “grammatical speech” (<foreign xml:lang="la"
                                >oratio gramatica</foreign>). The scribe of manuscript V<hi
                                rend="superscript">a</hi> evidently prioritized speed over neatness
                            of script and also had very idiosyncratic orthography, regularly
                            doubling single consonants or omitting one where they are normally
                            doubled. Given the ubiquity of these variants, I have omitted them from
                            the critical apparatus unless they are shared by other manuscripts. In
                            his edition of section IV, Coucke finds that V<hi rend="superscript"
                                >b</hi> contains the second version of Pietro’s commentary, but by
                            section XIX there is little evidence of V<hi rend="superscript">b</hi>
                            sharing readings characteristic of that second version. In addition, the
                            sub-family represented by V<hi rend="superscript">a</hi> and V<hi
                                rend="superscript">b</hi> is particularly important for the
                            commentary’s reception history since the incunable editions of the text
                            align most closely with them.</p>
                        <p n="3">The situation is more complicated with manuscript E<hi
                                rend="superscript">a</hi>. Coucke assigns manuscript E<hi
                                rend="superscript">a</hi> to the Jean de Jandun redaction, and in
                            section XIX the manuscript adopts many (though not all) of the omissions
                            that characterize that redaction, and it sometimes shares readings with
                                P<hi rend="superscript">z</hi>. Nonetheless, in non-omitted passages
                                E<hi rend="superscript">a</hi>’s text more closely resembles the
                            manuscripts transmitting Pietro’s first version. As a result, I
                            primarily affiliate it with that family of texts, with the proviso that
                            the scribe of E<hi rend="superscript">a</hi> evidently consulted a P<hi
                                rend="superscript">z</hi>-related manuscript from the Jandun
                            redaction as well.</p>

                        <head>2.4 Pietro d’Abano’s Second Version</head>
                        <p n="1">The second version of Pietro’s commentary, which I label κ, is also
                            found in five manuscripts: P<hi rend="superscript">x</hi>, V<hi
                                rend="superscript">m</hi>, V<hi rend="superscript">z</hi>, M<hi
                                rend="superscript">a</hi>, and M<hi rend="superscript">b</hi>. With
                            respect to the fourth section, Coucke hypothesized that manuscripts P<hi
                                rend="superscript">x</hi> and V<hi rend="superscript">b</hi> (which
                            in section IV transmits Pietro’s second version) most closely follow the
                            original form of the second version, that a further revised form of the
                            second version was the model for manuscripts M<hi rend="superscript"
                                >a</hi>, M<hi rend="superscript">b</hi>, and P<hi rend="superscript"
                                >z</hi>, and that manuscript V<hi rend="superscript">m</hi> shares
                            common error with these latter three (<ref target="Coucke2008">Coucke
                                2008</ref>, vol. 2, xxxix). Only some of Coucke’s observations hold
                            true in section XIX, however. I agree that a revised version, which I
                            call λ, was the model for many of these manuscripts. As mentioned above,
                            however, manuscript V<hi rend="superscript">b</hi> has switched its
                            affiliation and now follows Pietro’s first version, and P<hi
                                rend="superscript">z</hi> likewise has shifted to Jean of Jandun’s
                            redaction. Additionally, Coucke does not consider V<hi
                                rend="superscript">z</hi>, since it does not contain section IV.</p>
                        <p n="2">The resulting picture is that P<hi rend="superscript">x</hi>
                            follows the original form of the second version, and that M<hi
                                rend="superscript">a</hi>, M<hi rend="superscript">b</hi>, V<hi
                                rend="superscript">m</hi>, and V<hi rend="superscript">z</hi> derive
                            from λ, a revised version thereof. Coucke’s hypothesis of a further
                            revised source for M<hi rend="superscript">a</hi>, M<hi
                                rend="superscript">b</hi>, and P<hi rend="superscript">z</hi> (but
                            not V<hi rend="superscript">m</hi>) is not supported in section XIX,
                            since there is good reason to believe that M<hi rend="superscript"
                                >b</hi> is copied either directly from M<hi rend="superscript"
                                >a</hi> or from another copy of M<hi rend="superscript">a</hi>. For
                            instance, in problem 2 the scribe of M<hi rend="superscript">a</hi>
                            erroneously wrote <quote rend="inline">unaa</quote> instead of <quote
                                rend="inline">una,</quote> and M<hi rend="superscript">b</hi>’s
                            scribe wrote <quote rend="inline">unaa</quote> before deleting the
                            superfluous a. Still stronger evidence of copying is found in problem
                            3’s table of Greek note names, where M<hi rend="superscript">b</hi>’s
                            scribe was consulting a manuscript that breaks the word <quote
                                rend="inline">prollabamenos</quote> (<foreign xml:lang="la">recte:
                                proslambanomenos</foreign>) into <quote rend="inline">prolla</quote>
                            and <quote rend="inline">bamenos,</quote> as M<hi rend="superscript"
                                >a</hi> does. We can tell this because M<hi rend="superscript"
                                >b</hi>’s scribe evidently thought the line break divided two
                            distinct words: in M<hi rend="superscript">b</hi>, following <quote
                                rend="inline">prolla</quote> the rest of the line (about six
                            characters’ worth) is left blank, before the table of note names begins
                            at the top of the next column with <quote rend="inline">bamenos.</quote>
                            Furthermore, in problem 6 M<hi rend="superscript">b</hi>’s scribe
                            follows the word <foreign xml:lang="la">magnatis</foreign> with the
                            superfluous phrase <foreign xml:lang="la">uel huius est inequale non
                                eundem seruans tenorem</foreign> ahead of where it should occur in
                            the text, and then repeats it in the correct place, following <foreign
                                xml:lang="la">excellentis</foreign>. In this case of homeoteleuton
                            the -<foreign xml:lang="la">tis</foreign> endings of <foreign
                                xml:lang="la">magnatis</foreign> and <foreign xml:lang="la"
                                >excellentis</foreign> are nearly aligned in two successive lines of
                                M<hi rend="superscript">a</hi> (f. 97v), so it is very likely that
                                M<hi rend="superscript">b</hi>’s scribe’s eyes skipped from the end
                            of <foreign xml:lang="la">magnatis</foreign> down a line to <foreign
                                xml:lang="la">excellentis</foreign>, and then erroneously copied the
                            words that followed. In sum, because my collation of M<hi
                                rend="superscript">b</hi> across the first ten problems revealed no
                            meaningful discrepancies with M<hi rend="superscript">a</hi>, but rather
                            signs of direct copying, I conclude that it is not useful for
                            establishing the best text of Pietro’s second version.</p>
                        <p n="3">Of the remaining manuscripts in sub-family λ, V<hi
                                rend="superscript">m</hi> often preserves better readings than M<hi
                                rend="superscript">a</hi> and V<hi rend="superscript">z</hi>.
                            Additionally, V<hi rend="superscript">z</hi> may have been copied later,
                            as it is written on paper and is the only extant manuscript to be copied
                            in a single column. (Zanetti, however, dates it to about the fourteenth
                            century [<ref target="Zanetti1741">1741</ref>, 121].) Nonetheless, its
                            unique readings are not obviously inferior to those of M<hi
                                rend="superscript">a</hi>, so I have included its variants in the
                            critical apparatus throughout.</p>

                            reconstruct the best text of Pietro’s commentary, but it is still of
                            some interest. This is in part because <quote rend="inline">Jandun is
                                one of the most important thinkers in the Latin Averroist tradition
                                </quote>(<ref target="South2002">South 2002</ref>, 372), and
                            consequently his understanding of the <title ref="#ArPr"
                                >Problems</title> and Pietro’s commentary merits attention.
                            Furthermore, due to the significant circulation of Jean’s redaction in
                            the environs of the University of Paris it is valuable for understanding
                            the <title ref="#ArPr">Problems</title>’ reception. As a result, I have
                            included readings from selected manuscripts of Jean’s redaction in my
                            critical edition, but have also tagged them so that readers may filter
                            out readings only found in that redaction.</p>
                        <p n="2">Three broad feature of Jean’s redaction identified by Coucke in
                            section IV also occur in section XIX. First, the redaction is most
                            saliently characterized by omissions that <quote rend="inline">either
                                cover well defined text-units (paragraphs, or entire (subordinate)
                                clauses), or entail the removal of repetitive or superfluous
                                speech</quote> (<ref target="Coucke2008">2008</ref>, vol. 2: xxvii).
                            Second, as a whole the manuscripts of Jean’s redaction largely agree
                            with those of Pietro’s first version, but on occasion they follow his
                            second version instead, as Coucke found (xxx–xxxi). Third, as in section
                            IV manuscript Vo appears to be most valuable for establishing the text
                            of the redaction (xxxiii). It has almost no unique errors of any
                            importance, but a brief passage in problem 9 (<foreign xml:lang="la"
                                >utrobique existente. Et hoc quia in cantu</foreign>), which it
                            alone omits, indicates that it cannot be the direct (or at least the
                            sole) model for the rest of the redaction’s manuscripts.</p>
                        <p n="3">Beyond these broad characteristics, however, further clarity is
                            elusive. Whereas Coucke found that manuscripts P<hi rend="superscript"
                                >p</hi> and V<hi rend="superscript">c</hi> are “contaminated,” since
                            in section IV they complete the omissions which are otherwise
                            characteristic of Jean’s redaction (xxxi–xxxii), in section XIX P<hi
                                rend="superscript">p</hi> never does so and V<hi rend="superscript"
                                >c</hi> only sometimes does. Coucke then goes on to note of section
                            IV (and he observes that Delaurenti’s [then]-in-progress edition of
                            section VII confirms the same), that: <quote rend="blockquote"
                                source="Coucke2008">The other representatives of J [Jean’s
                                redaction], however, are hardly differentiated, and among them the
                                relations are volatile and changing. Yet, the samples allow for a
                                division of the manuscripts along two main branches: (1) one of them
                                is built around V<hi rend="superscript">o</hi>, C<hi
                                    rend="superscript">a</hi> and E<hi rend="superscript">a</hi>;
                                (2) another unites the distinct pair P<hi rend="superscript">q</hi>
                                    P<hi rend="superscript">u</hi> (xxxii).</quote> Broad outlines
                            of these relations among manuscripts are still present in section XIX:
                            in the first branch, C<hi rend="superscript">a</hi> and V<hi
                                rend="superscript">o</hi> are still closely related, but E<hi
                                rend="superscript">a</hi> now aligns better with Pietro’s first
                            version. In the second branch, moreover, frequent agreements of P<hi
                                rend="superscript">q</hi> with G<hi rend="superscript">u</hi> and
                                P<hi rend="superscript">u</hi> with P<hi rend="superscript">p</hi>
                            also emerge. The remaining manuscripts, V<hi rend="superscript">c</hi>,
                                P<hi rend="superscript">a</hi>, and S<hi rend="superscript">c</hi>,
                            do not clearly align with either branch.</p>
                        <p n="4">Given that Jean’s redaction cannot help to establish Pietro’s text,
                            I have not included all its manuscripts in the apparatus. I follow
                            Coucke (xxxiv) in selecting manuscripts V<hi rend="superscript">o</hi>,
                            due to its paucity of errors, and G<hi rend="superscript">u</hi>,
                            because of its careful preparation and occasional unique variants. I
                            also selected manuscript P<hi rend="superscript">z</hi>, on account of
                            its interest as it switches from Pietro’s second version to Jean’s
                            redaction. Because Coucke identified manuscripts P<hi rend="superscript"
                                >u</hi> and P<hi rend="superscript">q</hi> as constituting a
                            differentiated branch in section IV, I selected manuscript P<hi
                                rend="superscript">u</hi>, since by section XIX P<hi
                                rend="superscript">q</hi> closely matches G<hi rend="superscript"
                                >u</hi>. And finally I included manuscript P<hi rend="superscript"
                                >p</hi> to help establish the second branch’s readings. (Other
                            manuscripts from Jean’s redaction are also occasionally cited when they
                            support variants that would otherwise appear unique.)</p>

                    <p n="1">In section XIX of his commentary Pietro employs quotations in the same
                        two ways observed by Coucke in section IV: more literal quotations, which
                        come immediately after the source’s reference (usually cited by the work’s
                        author, title, and book number, when applicable), and loose paraphrases,
                        which precede the reference (<ref target="Coucke2008">2008</ref> vol. 2,
                        lxi). To this general pattern we may add a more specific observation: in
                        section XIX Pietro’s more literal quotations draw exclusively on Boethius
                        and Isidore, and he uses them to lay out background information about the
                        discipline of music’s terminology and its received history. He does this
                        most prominently in problem 1, but also later, too, for example in problems
                        3, 7, and 16. Pietro uses paraphrases, by contrast, largely to support or
                        exemplify his interpretive claims, and they come from a significantly wider
                        range of sources, as will now be addressed.</p>
                    <p n="2">The sources with which Pietro engages in section XIX fall into three
                        main categories: the Aristotelian corpus, medical texts, and late-Antique
                        writings on music. Pietro cites sources from the first category most
                        frequently. Cross-references abound to passages within the <title
                            ref="#ArPr">Problems</title>, from both section XIX and other sections,
                        and Pietro also cites other Aristotelian works that were well known in his
                        day, especially book VIII of the <title ref="#ArPo">Politics</title>. (Other
                        Aristotelian works with which Pietro engages in medical-focused sections of
                        the <title ref="#ArPr">Problems</title>, such as the <title>De generatio
                            animalium</title> and <title>De historia animalium</title> [<ref
                            target="Coucke2008">Coucke 2008</ref>, vol. 2, lxii], make no appearance
                        here.)</p>
                    <p n="3">Given section XIX’s dedication to the subject of music, the extent to
                        which Pietro incorporates medical sources, the second category, undoubtedly
                        speaks to his training as a physician. Three of these treatises are by
                        Galen, whom Claude Palisca misidentified as <quote rend="inline">an
                            otherwise unknown author Balienus</quote> in a chapter on Pietro (<ref
                            target="Palisca1985">1985</ref>, 55). The other medical sources range
                        from the better known, such Avicenna’s <title ref="#AvCa">Canon
                            medicinae</title>, to the obscure, for instance the <title ref="#MasAph"
                            >Aphorismi</title> of Yu&#x1E25;annā ibn Māsawaiyh, which Pietro
                        attributes to John of Damascus.</p>
                    <p n="4">The number of texts in the third category, writings on music, is very
                        small. While Pietro makes reference to Macrobius and Ptolemy, he
                        demonstrates first-hand knowledge of only Boethius’s <title ref="#BoMu">De
                            institutione harmonica</title> and the section (III.15–23) of Isidore’s
                            <title ref="#IsEt">Etymologies</title> which concerns music. He also has
                        at least passing familiarity with some aspects of medieval music theory, as
                        he makes reference to the <quote rend="inline">Guidonian tradition</quote>
                            (<foreign xml:lang="la">traditio Guidonis</foreign>) in problem 1 and on
                        occasion employs solmization syllables, but he displays no further awareness
                        of music-theoretical writing from after late Antiquity. (He is, however,
                        certainly aware of his day’s musical culture, as he discusses antiphonal
                        singing and medieval instruments, which are unmentioned in Boethius or
                        Isidore.)</p>

                        <p n="1">The textual tradition of Bartholomew of Messina’s Latin translation
                            of the pseudo-Aristotelian text is largely independent of Pietro’s
                            commentary, as only six of the twenty extant medieval manuscripts of
                            Pietro’s commentary include the entirety of Bartholomew’s translation.
                            Furthermore, sixty manuscripts contain part or the entirety of
                            Bartholomew’s text, compared to only around thirty for the commentary
                                (<ref target="Coucke2008">Coucke 2008</ref> vol. 1, xxxvi; vol. 2,
                            xxiii). As a result, a critically established text of the Latin
                            translation of section XIX is beyond the scope of this edition. For
                            readers’ convenience, though, I have included as a variant a
                            reconstruction of the version of Bartholomew’s translation which Pietro
                            likely consulted. This reconstruction is based on a critical edition of
                            that text, which I am preparing for publication, along with alterations
                            to the base text reflecting readings found in Pietro's commentary.</p>

                        <p n="1">To constitute the text and the critical apparatus I have accounted
                            for all the manuscripts containing Pietro’s first and second versions of
                            the commentary (except for manuscript M<hi rend="superscript">b</hi>,
                            since it is a copy of M<hi rend="superscript">a</hi>). I have also
                            included a selection of manuscripts from Jean of Jandun’s recension:
                                V<hi rend="superscript">o</hi>, G<hi rend="superscript">u</hi>, P<hi
                                rend="superscript">p</hi>, and P<hi rend="superscript">z</hi>.
                            Furthermore, readings from the two incunable editions are mentioned when
                            they agree on a unique reading or with variants found in other
                            manuscripts.</p>
                        <p n="2">In the edition’s text I aim to reconstruct Pietro’s second version
                            of the commentary, and consequently readings shared by manuscript P<hi
                                rend="superscript">x</hi> and family λ are preferred. Where their
                            readings diverge, if either P<hi rend="superscript">x</hi> or λ agree
                            with multiple manuscripts from Pietro’s first version, I prefer that
                            shared text. Where the surviving manuscripts of Pietro’s second version
                            are corrupt, manuscript P<hi rend="superscript">y</hi> (and N<hi
                                rend="superscript">u</hi>, when not lacunate) is generally
                            preferred.</p>
                        <p n="3">With respect to orthography, I have largely preserved medieval
                            spellings, rather than changing them to classical Latin standards. (The
                            most prominent exceptions are that words ending with -cio, -cia, and the
                            like have been changed to –tia, etc., and the –ij and –ijs endings to
                            –ii and –iis.) Because the digital critical edition allows readers to
                            choose whether to view orthographical variants, I have recorded most
                            spelling variances in the apparatus. Certain commonly occurring
                            differences have been silently normalized, however: <list>

                            </list> All contractions have been silently expanded, including the
                            ampersand and Tironian <foreign xml:lang="la">et</foreign>, and tall s (
                            ſ ) has been changed to round s. I have ignored all changes of hand
                            and/or ink for the marginal numbering of the problems.</p>
                        <p n="3">Punctuation varies widely among the manuscripts. I initially
                            adopted manuscript P<hi rend="superscript">x</hi>’s punctuation, which
                            is relatively sparse. Thereafter I added further punctuation in keeping
                            with modern practice, especially where it was lacking at points of
                            significant syntactic divisions. I followed a similar practice with
                            paragraph divisions, basing them on those found in P<hi
                                rend="superscript">x</hi>, and adding others at moments clearly
                            signaled by the text (such as new thoughts introduced by <foreign
                                xml:lang="la">nosce quod, notandum,</foreign> and the like).</p>
                        <p n="4">Relatedly, it should be noted that in section XIX manuscript V<hi
                                rend="superscript">a</hi> and the incunable editions mark the
                            beginnings of new paragraphs with <foreign xml:lang="la"
                                >deinde</foreign>. In section IV, however, Coucke shows while that
                            the manuscripts of Pietro’s second version (excepting V<hi
                                rend="superscript">b</hi>, which Coucke assigns to the second
                            version) use <foreign xml:lang="la">deinde</foreign> in that way, the
                            remaining manuscripts do not. The change of practice in V<hi
                                rend="superscript">a</hi> is easily explained: a new copyist takes
                            over at f. 47r, at which point that use of <foreign xml:lang="la"
                                >deinde</foreign> to mark new paragraphs begins. In the manuscripts
                            from Pietro’s second version, by contrast, that use of <foreign
                                xml:lang="la">deinde</foreign> gradually fades away, and seems
                            largely to disappear after problem 15 of section 11.</p>

                                    with columns one and two (note letters and string lengths), and
                                    then a second with column three (note names). Column four
                                    (interval sizes) is omitted. Pu's scribe writes the interval
                                    names orthogonal to the rest of the table and does not indicate
                                    the notes to which they apply. I have therefore omitted the
